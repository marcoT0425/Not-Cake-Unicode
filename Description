Font Updates:
First version of this font link.
My goal is to create as much Unicode characters as possible in a small grid. (But not over 65535)
Now 20130 Glyphs
The font created by @tacogod523 is completely invalid because a font cannot have more than 65535 glyphs. My font has dropped down to #13 in Most Glyphs. :( However, the font BabelStone Han is valid because it can support about 65533 glyphs. (25th May,2025)
It can support some cuneiform scripts, such as Old Persian.
Later, I will make Duployan, tai tham
